<h2><a name="Notes_on_the_Behavior_of_the_Social_Wasp_Polistes" id="Notes_on_the_Behavior_of_the_Social_Wasp_Polistes"></a>Notes on the Behavior of the Social Wasp Polistes</h2>

<p class="title">HORACE GUNTHORP<br />

<p>One day last September the writer picked up a nest of the common social wasp,
<i>Polistes</i>, which had been detached from its support, and placed it upon his desk. A
short time later he was attracted by a scratching sound, and discovered that one of
the wasps was just beginning to cut the cap from its cell preparatory to emerging.
During the next few days a series of observations were made and notes taken covering
the behavior of the wasps which emerged from their cells during that period. Miss
Enteman<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> has made a careful study of the instincts of the social wasps, and while the
observations recorded in the present paper are largely corroborative of her work, some
interesting details are here added.</p>

<p>The cutting of the cap of the cell occupied some time, and extended around four-fifths
of its circumference, the remaining one-fifth being gnawed and partially chewed
through so that it was flexible enough to act as a hinge for the cap. After the cap was
sufficiently cut away, the wasp started to slowly work itself out, pushing up the top
of the cell like a trap door as progress was made. A good deal of effort was required
to get the body out until the front legs were freed. Then the wasp had more purchase
and progress was somewhat faster until the second pair of legs came out. After this
slight effort seemed to be necessary for the completion of the operation.</p>

<p>For the next thirty minutes careful observations were made of the movements of
this wasp in order to ascertain its first reactions. It is evident that they would be
somewhat modified from what they are here recorded if the colony had contained the
queen and other workers, as this specimen had the run of the entire nest, and none of
its movements were effected by those of other individuals. It is equally evident that
all stimuli came from within, or from contact with the nest, and not from suggestions
received from other individuals or from contact with them. The following is the
record made at one minute intervals, beginning with the time the specimen left its cell:</p>

<div class="i4">
<p>8:06. Specimen emerged from its cell.</p>

<p>8:07. Cleaned its front legs in its mouth and its antennæ with its front legs.</p>

<p>8:08. Moved around some. Rubbed its wings with its hind legs and spread them out
twice.</p>

<p>8:09. Cleaned antennæ and front legs.</p>

<p>8:10. Swung abdomen back and forth, and brushed its wings. Moved around the nest
rapidly and waved the antennæ, but all movements were jerky.</p>

<p>8:11. Explored nest, occasionally rubbing abdomen with legs.</p>

<p>8:12. Explored nest.</p>

<p>8:13. Explored nest. Movements unsteady. Cleaned antennæ and front legs.</p>

<p>8:14. Explored nest, in the course of which it went over the edge on to the back side,
but immediately returned to the under side. Cleaned the front legs and
antennæ, and then the hind legs.</p>

<p>8:15. Spread out the wings. Cleaned the antennæ.</p>

<p>8:16. Cleaned abdomen.</p>

<p>8:17. Crawled on top or back side of nest again and stayed there. Cleaned wings
and abdomen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>
<p>8:18. Explored top. Cleaned front legs and antennæ.</p>

<p>8:19. Stood still. Occasional movement of head, antennæ or abdomen.</p>

<p>8:20. Same as 8:19.</p>

<p>8:21. Began to explore again, becoming quite lively. Antennæ constantly waving.</p>

<p>8:22. Same as 8:21, but extended its travels to the under (cell) side of the nest.</p>

<p>8:23. Left the nest entirely and began to walk around the surface of the desk.</p>

<p>8:24. Started to climb a bottle that was some six inches from the nest. Antennæ still
waving.</p>

<p>8:25. On the neck of the bottle, two inches above the surface of the desk. Cleaned
front legs and antennæ.</p>

<p>8:26. Quiet except that it spread its wings once.</p>

<p>8:27. Still on neck of bottle. Moved its head and antennæ back and forth.</p>

<p>8:28. Slight change in position. Antennæ were still waving. Rubbed its wings, spread
them, and then rubbed them again.</p>

<p>8:29. Rubbed its hind legs together vigorously.</p>

<p>8:30. Spread wings once, then rubbed them and the abdomen with the hind legs.
Rubbed the hind legs together, and finally rubbed the right wings vigorously.</p>

<p>8:31. Moved around some, occasionally stopping to rub the right wings.</p>

<p>8:32. Explored the neck of the bottle.</p>

<p>8:33. Same as 8:32. Cleaned antennæ.</p>

<p>8:34. Same as 8:33.</p>

<p>8:35. Stood still but continued to clean antennæ and front legs.</p>

<p>8:36. Climbed up and explored the cork of the bottle.</p>

<p>8:37-8:40. Stood still on the cork, occasionally moving its jaws.</p>
</div>

<p>At 8:40 the nest was placed against the cork and the wasp immediately crawled
onto it, but seemed restless. As the nest has a faint, but distinct, odor of honey, it was
probably attracted to it through the sense of smell.</p>

<p>The next morning the specimen was nowhere in sight, but forty-eight hours later it
fell out of a loose-leaf binder that had been lying on the desk. It seemed to be as
active as when seen two days before. Some time during the second night after the
appearance of the first specimen, that is, when it was some thirty hours old, a second
individual emerged. This one was discovered on a pile of books two feet from the
nest where it had evidently crawled soon after emerging.</p>

<p>As soon as the first specimen was rediscovered, that is, when it was sixty hours
old, the second wasp then being thirty hours old, the two were placed on the nest, and
this in turn was placed on a book. They both started on tours of observation, and
every time they came in contact with each other they made sudden starts and jumps
to avoid an evidently startling new object, meanwhile violently waving their antennæ
and often cleaning these organs after such contact. Dr. Enteman says, "All wasps
possess the instinct of fear. This ... is readily overcome by the frequent appearance
of the awe-inspiring object." This is true, because they were evidently on
familiar terms with each other in half an hour, and paid very little attention to the
frequent meetings which before had apparently distressed them. They wandered
freely over their nest and the top surface of the book on which it was placed, but did
not attempt to climb off the latter.</p>

<p>At 12 o'clock, four hours later, a third wasp had appeared, and none of the specimens
seemed to be disturbed by the presence of the others. When the nest was first
picked up, one cell containing a well formed pupa was uncapped. This specimen was
then alive, but it may have been dead at the time of this observation. In either case,
it had been dragged out of its cell, decapitated, and the front legs torn off. No trace
of the head was found, but the body and legs were on the book about one inch from
the nest. Whether this act was connected with the hunger of the wasps themselves or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
with the first development of the instinct of feeding the larvæ in the nest, which Miss
Enteman says begins without imitation, is not clear.</p>

<p>At 2 p. m. (two hours later) the colony was placed out of doors, still on the book.
Two of the wasps soon left the latter, and settled near it, keeping very quiet for half
an hour. The third kept climbing over and around the nest. At 2:30 one of the two
wasps returned to the nest.</p>

<p>At 3 p. m. two of the specimens were on the ground near the porch. They made
only short flights, resembling jumps with the wings assisting, this being true even when
they were disturbed. The third wasp was beside the colony, chewing on the decapitated
pupa, probably getting some nourishment from it in the process.</p>

<p>During the afternoon the nest was disturbed, and at 6 p. m. all three specimens
had gone from the porch. One was found wandering aimlessly on a canna leaf near
by. It did not seem to be able to fly well. The other two had disappeared entirely.</p>

<p>The nest was saved and several days later a fourth wasp appeared. It was a
very lively specimen, and spent the first few hours actively exploring the nest. It
seemed of a very nervous disposition, being more easily disturbed than any of the
others had been. Every time the nest was picked up, it would start for the fingers or
forceps holding it. At one time it was observed with its whole body in a cell, head
downward, evidently examining the interior. After staying close to the nest for a day,
it began to fly around the floor of the room, paying no more attention to its former
home. Even when it was placed on or near it, it would almost immediately crawl or
fly away. Its flying was erratic, and seemed to lack power, but it got along much
better than any of the other three had done.</p>

<p>From the above observations it would appear that the movements of the wasp
recorded at one minute intervals after emergence from its cell were probably reactions
due to the discomfort of the drying and hardening of the tissues. At first the wasps
apparently had very little, if any, home instinct. The only things to indicate that
they had any were the facts that the first specimen so readily left the cork on which it
was sitting and went back to its nest when the latter was held near it, and the fourth
wasp stayed on or near the nest for the first twelve hours. But all the specimens
observed left the nest the first night and showed no intention or disposition to return.
The presence of a second wasp seemed to bring the home instinct into existence more
forcibly, as the first and second wasps stayed with the nest for six or seven hours
when they were returned to it together, while the fourth one repeatedly left the empty
nest almost at once when it was returned to it. But this instinct was seemingly not very
strong, as they soon wandered away when placed out of doors. They seemed to have
no idea as to how to carry on the work of the colony, but wandered aimlessly over it.
Perhaps this was due to the fact that they were too young, as Miss Enteman says the
development of the nursing instinct is usually manifested "any time after the first half
day of imaginal life," but was observed in some neuters as young as four hours, while
in others it was delayed for two weeks.</p>

<p>While the above observations are admittedly too few from which to draw definite
conclusions, they seem to warrant the following assumptions, the first three of which
are quoted from Miss Enteman, and hence are simply corroborative of her work:</p>

<div class="i2"><p>1. "All wasps possess the instinct of fear. This is especially strong the first few days
after emergence, but is readily overcome by the frequent appearance of the
awe-inspiring object.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>2. "In a sense, the wasp remembers. This is indicated by the manner in which it
accustoms itself to the sight of strange objects, and by its behavior when a
change is made in its nest or surroundings.</p>

<p>3. "It shows considerable individual variability, both as to time and manner of its
response to stimuli."</p>

<p>4. After emergence, the first reactions are associated simply with the discomfort of
the hardening of the tissues.</p>

<p>5. It has marked curiosity, as shown by its repeated inspection of its nest and other
familiar objects.</p>

<p>6. The "home instinct" seems to be slight when the wasp is alone, but becomes stronger
when two or more are on the same nest.</p>

<p>7. The olfactory sense is closely associated with the early instincts of the wasp.</p></div>

<h3>DISCUSSION OF THE GENUS</h3>

<p>The genus <i>Dicranoptycha</i> was erected by Osten Sacken in 1860 (Proc. Acad. Nat.
Sci. Phila. for 1859, p. 217). The genus includes a small group of crane-flies with a
Holarctic distribution, there being about six species in North America and two, or possibly
three, in Europe. As I have indicated elsewhere, <i>D. signaticollis</i> v.d.W. of Java
is undoubtedly a species of <i>Libnotes</i>. Of the American species, <i>D. germana</i> O.S. is
characteristic of the Canadian life-zone of northeastern America. <i>D. sobrina</i> O.S. is
widely distributed in the United States and southern Canada, usually occurring in the
Transitional and Upper Austral life-zones. So far as known at present it is the only
species of the genus occurring on the Pacific slope. The remaining American species
(<i>nigripes</i> O.S., <i>winnemana</i> Alex., <i>tigrina</i> Alex. and <i>minima</i> Alex.) are Austral in distribution,
occurring in the southeastern and south central United States. A more detailed
account of the distribution of the species is given in another paper by the writer
which may be consulted (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila. for 1916, pp. 496, 497). All of
the known species are generally similar to one another in appearance and are separated
by relatively slight differences of size, color and structure.</p>

<p>Nothing has ever been written concerning the immature stages of this peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
group of crane-flies. The species described hereinafter were reared at Lawrence,
Kansas, and the general conditions under which they occur may be briefly discussed:</p>

<p>North Hollow, on the Campus of the University of Kansas, is a typical dry Austral
woodland traversed by a small stream that is entirely dry during the months of midsummer
drought. The soil consists of a rich black humus that is soft and mellow
except during the period of greatest dryness, being overlain by a varying depth of vegetable
debris and leaf-mold. It is in this relatively dry soil that the larvæ of
<i>Dicranoptycha</i> occur. The forest cover consists of Carolina poplar, <i>Populus deltoides</i>
Marsh; black walnut, <i>Juglans nigra</i> L., white elm, <i>Ulmus americana</i> L.; Kentucky
coffee-tree, <i>Gymnocladus dioica</i> (L.) Koch; honey locust, <i>Gleditsia triacanthos</i> L.; red
bud, <i>Cercis canadensis</i> L.; yellow wood, <i>Cladrastis lutea</i> (Mx.f.) Koch; tree-of-heaven,
<i>Ailanthus glandulosa</i> Desf., etc. The principle shrubs are the goose-berry, <i>Ribes
gracile</i> Mx.; poison ivy, <i>Rhus Toxicodendron</i> L.; wahoo, <i>Evonymus atropurpureus</i>
Jacq.; bladder-nut, <i>Staphylea trifolia</i> L.; coral-berry, <i>Symphoricarpos orbiculatus</i>
Moench.; blackberried elder, <i>Sambucus canadensis</i> L., etc. The herbage is made up
of tall grasses, composites and, in the spring, the all-dominant cleavers, <i>Galium</i>. In
addition to the above, great tangles of lianas (<i>Smilax</i>, <i>Vitis</i>, <i>Ampelopsis</i>, etc.) are
found.</p>

<p>In situations such as the above these Austral species of <i>Dicranoptycha</i> spend their
entire lives. The first larvæ of <i>D. winnemana</i> were found here on March 20, 1918,
by the writer and his wife. At this time they were well grown (length 16 mm.; diameter
0.9 mm.). They occurred just beneath the cover of fallen leaves and other debris
in the upper layers of soil. Here they were associated with pupæ of <i>Tipula angustipennis</i>
Lw., larvæ of <i>Sciara</i> (Mycetophilidæ); <i>Psilocephala hæmorrhoidalis</i> Macq.
(Therevidæ), numerous beetle larvæ, centipedes, etc. By their elongate form and
glabrous shiny skin they are very characteristic and easily recognized. The glassy
appearance of the body suggests the shiny shells of a small coiled molluscan whose
dead fragments occurred in some numbers in the same situations. These larvæ were
placed in rearing and the first adults appeared in the breeding-cages on May 6, and
from that time on continued to appear in large numbers. It was over a month later
that the first individuals were taken in the field. The pupal duration could not be
determined closer than ten days, and this may be the usual length of time required
for this stage. The first larvæ of <i>D. minima</i> were found on July 2, 1918, in similar
situations in North Hollow. At this time they were only about one-half grown. On
July 11 much larger larvæ of this species were secured and placed in rearing, emerging
as adults on July 21. The larvæ, like these of <i>D. winnemana</i>, live just beneath
the layer of leaf-mold in the upper zone of black soil. They are usually quite sluggish
in their motions but at other times are quite active. The larvæ are herbivores
and feed on the rich organic earth in their haunts. When ready to pupate, they
encase themselves in earthen cells (10 mm. × 3.5 mm.), firm in texture, rather thick-walled
but without silk. There is a small opening at either end. The length of the
cavity is but little greater than the pupa itself. In this cavity the pupa rests and
matures. As in other insects, the teneral pupæ are very pale yellow but gradually
darken in color until, at emergence, they are of a dark brownish-black. When newly
transformed the teneral flies rest on the ground and on the leaves of low plants nearby.</p>

<p>The adult flies of <i>D. germana</i> usually occur in the immediate neighborhood of
running or stagnant water and may be swept from the rank vegetation in such places.
The flies rest on the upper surface of the leaves of tall herbs and low shrubs. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
eastern Kansas, the flies of <i>D. winnemana</i>, <i>D. tigrina</i> and <i>D. minima</i> often occur
together. In June, <i>D. winnemana</i> appears on the wing and is found associated with
<i>Tipula morrisoni</i> Alex., <i>T. mingwe</i> Alex., etc.; in July, <i>D. minima</i> appears, together
with <i>Tipula flavibasis</i> Alex., <i>T. unimaculata</i> Lw., etc.; still later in July <i>D. tigrina</i>
emerges and all three species fly together during August and into September when
they fly with <i>Tipula ultima</i> Alex., <i>T. unifasciata</i> Lw., etc. It is curious that no other
species of Limnobiinæ occur in the thamnophytic association frequented by <i>Dicranoptycha</i>.
All three species of this genus as discussed above have habits that are generally
similar to one another. They are usually found resting quietly on the upper
surface of the leaves but fly readily and on slight disturbance. Pairs in copulation
are often found resting, the bodies directed away from one another and the wings
folded over the abdomen. While thus united they fly readily, sometimes the female
taking the initiative, sometimes the rather smaller male. The eggs are deposited in
the soft earth in these situations.</p>


<h3>NATURAL AFFINITIES</h3>

<p>In the Monographs (1869) Osten Sacken included the genus <i>Dicranoptycha</i> in his
tribe (section) Limnobina anomala, or, as it subsequently became known, the Rhamphidini,
and still later the Antochini. A recent survey of the immature stages of several
Antochine genera has shown that the tribe is merely an artificial grouping based on
superficial resemblance of the adult flies. This heterogeneous assemblage includes
representatives of at least three other tribes, <i>Dicranoptycha</i>, together with <i>Antocha</i>,
<i>Elliptera</i>, <i>Rhamphidia</i>, etc., showing an undeniable affinity with the Limnobiini,
whereas <i>Teucholabis</i>, <i>Elephantomyia</i>, etc., show an equally clear relationship with the
Eriopterini. Moreover a close phylogenetic relationship with the lowermost subtribes
of the Hexatomini (<i>Ularia</i>, <i>Epiphragmaria</i>, etc.), is easily apparent.</p>

<p><i>Dicranoptycha</i> shows the closest affinities with <i>Antocha</i> and <i>Rhamphidia</i>. The
larvæ of these three genera, each of which typifies a division, show the following
common characters:</p>

<p>Abdominal segments with basal transverse creeping welts or areas of microscopic
points. The massive compact head-capsule with the præfrontal sclerite large, distinct,
the externo-lateral plates large, mussel-shaped and very thin. The mentum is not
completely divided medially. The maxillæ are large and of primitive structure,
the cardines and stipites distinct, the two distal lobes large, subequal in size, covered
with hairs and bearing sensory organs. Mandibles with one or more dorsal and two
or more ventral teeth in addition to the apical point.</p>

<p>The differences between these allied divisions are best indicated by a key.</p>

<h4>DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIES</h4>

<p>1916 <i>Dicranoptycha winnemana</i> Alexander; Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., pp. 500, 501;
Pl. 25, fig. 12.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Larva.</i>&mdash;Length, 20-22 mm.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.75em;">Diameter, 0.9-1.1 mm.</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Coloration varying from white to almost black depending on the nature and
amount of the food eaten which shows clearly through the transparent integument.
The fat-bodies likewise show through and give a white color to the larva especially
after death.</p>

<p>Form very elongate (<a href="#i001">fig. 1</a>), body terete; integument very glabrous, transparent
and glassy. Prothoracic segment a little longer than the mesothorax which, in turn,
slightly exceeds the metathorax. The intermediate abdominal segments are elongated.
The basal ring of sternites two to eight bears a transverse band or area of microscopic
chitinized spicules, the one on the eighth segment split lengthwise by a capillary line.
A similar band occurs in the same position on the dorsum of the eighth segment but
the pleural region is devoid of such a band.</p>

<p>Spiracular disk (<a href="#i002">fig. 8</a>) moderate in size, obliquely truncated, surrounded by four
lobes, a pair of small, slender, lateral lobes and short, broader ventral lobes. The
usual dorso-median lobe is lacking but its position is indicated by a gently rounded
convexity. The inner face of the lateral lobe bears a narrow semi-lunate black mark
with the concavity toward the spiracle, the proximal end acutely pointed. The ventral
lobes bear a similar but smaller subrectangular black mark. A pale and usually
indistinct dusky mark occupies the inner face of the dorsal lobe. On the disk between,
and slightly below the level of, the spiracles is a large brown triangular or V-shaped
mark. The spiracles are small, separated from one another by a distance equal to
about 2.5 to 3 times the diameter of one; the center-piece of the spiracle is black, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
ring yellow surrounded by an outer dusky margin. Anal gills fleshy and protuberant
as a blunt ring surrounding the anus (<a href="#i002">fig. 10</a>).</p>

<p>Head-capsule (<a href="#i001">fig. 2</a>) of the compact, massive type of the Limnobiini; præfrontal
sclerite (<a href="#i001">fig. 3</a>) large and distinct; the sclerite broad with the sides subparallel to
about midlength, thence tapering gradually to the tip which is entire; there are two
or three punctures at the margin before midlength. Interno-lateral plates narrow, a
little longer than the præfrons; externo-lateral plates very broad, thin and flattened
with the posterior margin very obtuse and the inner ventral portions continuous with
the mental plate. Labrum (<a href="#i001">fig. 3</a>) very broad and extensive, flattened, pale in color,
the anterior margin with about two sense-organs. Mentum (<a href="#i001">fig. 4</a>) deeply split
behind but not completely divided, the anterior margin with three primary teeth that
are subequal in size or the middle one a little smaller; a much reduced lateral tooth
on either side. Præmentum smaller than the hypopharynx, in outline roughly oval or
semicircular with the two labial palpi surrounded by hairs at the base. Hypopharynx
(<a href="#i001">fig. 5</a>) consisting of two chitinized arms that are contiguous but not fused medially,
the concavity between them filled with a rounded cushion that is covered with tubercles
arranged in more or less distinct oblique parallel rows. Antennæ (<a href="#i001">fig. 6</a>) two-segmented,
the basal segment cylindrical with an auditory plate on the face at beyond
midlength; apical segment long and slender, in length but slightly less than the basal
segment, tapering gradually to the bluntly rounded apex. Mandibles (<a href="#i001">fig. 7</a>) simple
with the teeth blunt; apical point longer than the lateral teeth; dorsal tooth single,
broad, very flattened and obtusely pointed; ventral teeth two, a little smaller than
the dorsal tooth. Maxillæ (<a href="#i001">fig. 2</a>) of a generalized structure, the cardines distinct and
feebly chitinized; distal lobes of the organ consisting of a subequal inner and outer
lobe; the outer lobe with an abundance of long, delicate hairs and bearing a few
sensory papillæ including one larger palpiform organ.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>Thoracic dorsum shiny light brown; in very old pupæ the color is much darker,
but still retains a much brighter color than the leg and wing-sheaths; abdomen pale
becoming darker in age, especially on the pleura.</p>

<p>Cephalic crest (<a href="#i002">fig. 13</a>) low and depressed, inconspicuous, lying between the
antennal bases which extend beyond it; there are four small setigerous lobes, the
larger pair of which are posterior in position. Front between the eyes broad, subparallel.
Two blunt tubercles on either side of the forehead. Eyes large, with coarse
ommatidia. Labrum semicircular in outline, tumid. Labial lobes large, oval, contiguous
with one another, at the tip of the labrum. Maxillary palpi moderately long
and slender, nearly straight, gradually narrowed to the tip which ends opposite the
knee-joint of the fore legs. Antennæ with the basal segments separated only by the
cephalic crest, the sheaths ending about opposite or a little before the lateral angle
of the thorax.</p>

<p>Pronotal breathing-horns (<a href="#i002">fig. 14</a>) very small, almost microscopic; when viewed
from the dorsal aspect appearing as tiny triangular tubercles. Mesonotum moderately
convex, unarmed, the V-shaped suture distinct; a few setæ on the mesonotum, including
one near the end of each scutal lobe. Wing-sheaths rather short, but narrow, ending
about opposite midlength of the third abdominal segment. Leg-sheaths ending opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
the base of the fifth abdominal segment, the tips of the tarsi ending about on a common
level or those of the fore legs a trifle longer.</p>

<p>Abdominal segments (<a href="#i002">fig. 11</a>) subdivided into four annuli that bear transverse
bands of microscopic setæ; these bands increase in width from the basal to the apical.
Spiracles on the pleural region of segments two to seven, lying opposite the third
annulus and close to the ventral margin of the pleura. No spiracles are discernible
on the dorsum of the eighth segment. Male cauda (<a href="#i002">fig. 11</a>) with the ventral lobes
very blunt, rounded; the dorsal lobes very small, terminating in a sharp spine that
is directed dorsad and bears a weak seta near its base. Female cauda (<a href="#i002">fig. 12</a>) with
the ventral lobes a little longer than the dorsal lobes; the latter at the outer angle of
the apex with a short stout spine that is directed dorsad as in the male.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Central_Nervous_System_of" id="The_Central_Nervous_System_of"></a>The Central Nervous System of<br />
Nucula and Malletia</h2>

<p class="title">WILLIAM A. HILTON</p>


<p>These bivalve forms are grouped among the simplest of the molloscs. It is especially
from the condition in <i>Nucula</i> as described by Pelseneer '91, that the conception
of the most anterior ganglion being composed of four ganglia, has its chief support.
Drew '01, who has also studied <i>Nucula</i>, believes that the lobes of the ganglion in
<i>Nucula</i> are superficial and that the four connectives coming from the ganglion may
be interpreted in another way. That is, that one pair of nerves may represent an
otocystic branch partly fused with the connective. This view seemed reasonable to
him as Stempel '99 in <i>Solenyma</i> found the otocystic nerves arose directly from the
cerebral ganglion.</p>

<p>The two species of this group used for study were collected at Laguna Beach.
<i>Nucula castrensis</i> Hinds, occurs abundantly at low tide under rocks. It is rather
small for dissection, but very good complete series were obtained and stained in
hematoxylin. <i>Malletia faba</i> Dall, was much less abundant. Specimens were obtained
from holdfasts or from dredging. Although this was a larger species, gross dissection
was not very easily carried out on any of the specimens, but good series were made.</p>

<p>The ganglia of <i>Nucula</i> are easily studied in section. The cerebral mass seems
composed of one main mass, partly divided into four subdivisions, the two central
most completely fused, and the lateral quite distinct in places. The central portion
might represent the cerebral ganglia and the lateral, the pleural if we take that interpretation.
The pedal ganglion is made of right and left parts quite completely fused
except at the margins. The pedal mass is the smallest of the three chief ganglionic
areas. The visceral ganglia are quite widely separated and a little larger than the
pedal mass.</p>

<p>The ganglia of <i>Malletia</i> are in general plan similar to those of <i>Nucula</i>, the greatest
differences being in the cerebral mass. The cerebro-pleural mass seems almost one.
In most sections it is very compact and a little more complicated in structure than
the ganglion of <i>Nucula</i>. However there are two small ventral ganglionic branches
or small ganglia attached to the ventral side of the cerebral mass. These small
ganglia may represent the visceral. Farther back in a cross section series as the
cerebral mass disappears two other small branches take origin and run parallel to
the nerves from the ganglionic cords. These two branches on each side seem to run
together before the pedal ganglia are reached. Neither of these pairs of nerves seems
connected with an otocyst.</p>

<p>At the cephalic end of the cerebro-pleural ganglion the large ganglionic cords
are in evidence. A little distance from the cephalic end on the dorsal side there
are quite large groups of cells down from the surface and surrounded by nerve fibers.
The course of the fibers here is quite complex. On the ventral lateral sides of the
ganglia are paired light areas of fibers which may be traced into the fibers of the
ganglionic cords.</p>

<p>The pedal ganglion is small and much as in <i>Nucula</i>. The visceral ganglia are
larger and widely separated.</p>

<p>In both <i>Nucula</i> and <i>Malletia</i> young specimens were used for study. In <i>Nucula</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
there was more the appearance of four ganglia in the cerebro-pleural mass, and the
ganglia seem less complex than in <i>Malletia</i>. This last species has more separate
pleural ganglia, if the ganglionic cords can be so regarded.</p>

<p>In neither of the species studied were all parts of the connectives easy to follow,
so it was impossible to test the suggestions of Drew, but in both species there is
some indication of two lateral lobes of the cerebral mass, and in <i>Nucula</i> there is good
evidence of two central ganglia as well as the smaller lateral ones. The lateral
ganglia of the cerebral mass are most clearly separated in <i>Malletia</i>. In <i>Nucula</i> the
lateral ganglia are larger in proportion and the distribution of the gray and white
matter is more irregular.</p>

<p>Located in one of the most healthful and beautiful parts of the
west coast. The mountains reach an elevation of ten thousand feet
within a few miles of the college and these with the nearby ocean
afford many special advantages for the study of things not in books.
Special advantages are afforded by the fact that the college limits
its attendance, the freshman class being restricted to two hundred
applicants. The success of the college is particularly indicated by
the large proportion of the graduates who proceed to advanced
work in the large universities. In addition, well-manned departments
of music and art afford exceptional advantages.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
